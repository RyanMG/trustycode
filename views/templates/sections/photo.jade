        h3 so I will keep this part brief.

          | I studied filmmaking once upon a time, training and then
          | working as a cinematographer for films and commercials.
        p
          | These day I shoot photographs - digitally most of the time
          | for the flexibility it offers. I shoot dance, headshots,
          | portraits - basically people. Because what else could
          | be as interesting to capture as the moments that define
          | a person?
