          | Hey there! I am David Ryan Hall - part tech geek, part artist, all
          | rock and roll. I create things, and this is my showcase for the work
          | I’ve done! Have a look around, see what catches your fancy!

              | I make websites, applications and other techy things which are are
              | generally rad. With a year+ experience, I blend my design experience
              | with technical skills to make the web more beatiful as well as functional.

              | Solid aesthetics with a mind towards functionality and the conveyance
              | of the proper message. Good design isn’t just pretty to look at - it
              | also needs to serve a purpose. I help tell stories through visual mediums.

              | A picture is worth 1000 words, but a great picure is an entire narriative.
              | It’s not about smiling and saying ‘cheese’ - it’s about capturing a
              | moment that matters. 1/60th of a second is all I need write your story.
