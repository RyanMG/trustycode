working as a cinematographer for films and commercials.</p><p>These day I shoot photographs - digitally most of the time
for the flexibility it offers. I shoot dance, headshots,
portraits - basically people. Because what else could
be as interesting to capture as the moments that define
a person?</p><h3>Why am I still talking?
